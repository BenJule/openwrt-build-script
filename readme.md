## Cleaning Up (in openwrt directory)

### Clean

````
make clean
````

deletes contents of the directories /bin and /build_dir. make clean does not remove the toolchain, it also avoids cleaning architectures/targets other than the one you have selected in your .config


### Dirclean

````
make dirclean
````

deletes contents of the directories /bin and /build_dir and additionally /staging_dir and /toolchain (=the cross-compile tools) and /logs. 'Dirclean' is your basic "Full clean" operation.

### Distclean

````
make distclean
````

nukes everything you have compiled or configured and also deletes all downloaded feeds contents and package sources.

*CAUTION* : In addition to all else, this will erase your build configuration (<buildroot_dir>/.config), your toolchain and all other sources. Use with care!
